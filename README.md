  * Your work will be done inside the file main-scene.js.  The code comments of that file should help you get started with modifying a Scene object.  Later, when you're curious you can explore the documentation of the rest of the codebase (which appears in the files themselves, as comments).

# tiny-graphics-js

This is a small, single file JavaScript utility for organizing WebGL programs to be object-oriented and minimally cluttered.  This tiny library gives your WebGL program access to linear algebra routines, useful UI controls and readouts, and the drawing utilities needed by modern shader-based graphics.  It factors away the repetitive logic of GPU communication into re-usable objects.
